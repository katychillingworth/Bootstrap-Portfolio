# Bootstrap Portfolio Challenge
https://katychillingworth.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/

## What I did:
Using Bootstrap, I added the following onto my webpage:
• Nav bar
• Jumbotron
• Cards displaying my work
• An about me section
• Smaller cards showcasing skills I've learned
• A form to contact me 
• A simple footer with some dummy social media links.

I added a hover box shadow effect on the only button I have on the webpage
The links in the navbar link to the corresponding sections
